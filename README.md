# Threaded-Matrix-Multiplication
Implementing two variations of matrix multiplication algorithm using threads: 
1. The computation of each element of the output matrix happens in a thread. 
2. The computation of each row of the output matrix happens in a thread.

For both variations, compute the elapsed time for each of them and compare between them.
